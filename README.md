# MagicFinder
MagicFinder is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to keep track your Magic Find buffs when you're farming bags in the Mad King's Labyrinth.

Icons for Magic Find buffs are displayed in one or two columns that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed out so you can quickly see what needs to be reapplied. 

Buffs are loosely grouped into three sections according to expiration and availability. Some buffs use alternate icons to more easily distinguish them. For example, the _Ace Racer,_ _Approval of the Mad King_, and _Grudging Approval_ buffs all have the same icon on your in-game Effects Monitor, so MagicFinder uses a racing beetle and cat icon for the first and last, respectively.
