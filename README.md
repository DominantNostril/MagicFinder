MagicFinder is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to keep track of your Magic Find buffs when you're bag farming in the Mad King's Labyrinth.

Icons for Magic Find buffs are displayed in one or two columns that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed-out so you can quickly see what needs to be reapplied. 

## Effects
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9018c29-287e-4026-b73c-ef8f21c9f2f8" width="6%">  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a41aadb-1fff-4c45-9e0d-54f7d32795e7" width="8%">

Effects are loosely grouped into three sections according to expiration and availability. Some effects use alternate icons to more easily distinguish them. For example, the _Ace Racer,_ _Approval of the Mad King_, and _Grudging Approval_ buffs all have the same icon on your in-game effects monitor, so MagicFinder uses a racing beetle and cat icon for the first and last, respectively.

All trackable Magic Find buffs that apply in the Labyrinth are included (see the wiki for a [complete list of Magic Find buffs and sources](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find#Attribute)). These are:
* Magic Find Boost, +50% MF (Bonfire, MF/Enchanted Booster, Fireworks)
* Celebration Bonus, +100% MF (Birthday/Celebration Booster)
* Guild Magic Find Banner Boost, +15% (Guild Gold and Magic Find Banners, Guild Heroes Banners, and Guild Anniversary Banners)
* Spirit Banner Boost, +10% MF (Spirit Banner)
* Item Booster (effect), +50% MF (Candy Corn Gobbler, Item/Heroic/Enchanted Booster)
* New Year's Gift, +10% MF (Fireworks)
* Nourishment, +3%-40% MF (Various food)
* Enhancement, +30% MF (Various utility consumables)
* Ace Racer, +25% MF (Lab Mount Race)
* Approval of the Mad King, +25%-125% MF (Lab Boss Kills)
* Grudging Approval, +25% MF (Madame Cookie)
* Enlightenment, +10% MF (Training Ground)
* Guild Item Research, +10% MF (Bartender in Guild Hall)
* Ward's Remembrance, +15% MF (Astral Ward Memorial)
* Black Lion Boost, +100% MF (Black Lion Statuettes)

### Food
**Included Food:**
* Chocolate Omnomberry Cream 9987
* Peppermint Omnomberry Bar 34188
* Spicy Pumpkin Cookie / Court Chef 15260

The food effects commonly recommended for the Lab are implemented, but users may manually add the effect IDs for whichever other nourishment they're using ([see this wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Nourishment_effect_ids) for nourishment effect IDs). Note that only three utility consumables have Magic Find so all are implemented.
