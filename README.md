# MagicFinder
Experience Buff Tracker is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to keep track your Magic Find buffs when you're farming bags in the Mad King's Labyrinth.

Icons for common experience-modifying effects are displayed in a single column that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed out to aid the player in determing what to apply.

Buffs are loosely grouped into three sections according to expiration and availability. Some buffs use alternate icons to more easily distinguish them. For example, the _Ace Racer,_ _Grudging Approval,_ and _Approval of the Mad King_ buffs all have the same icon on your in-game Effects Monitor, so Magic Finder uses a Beetle and Cat for the first two, respectively.
