# MagicFinder
MagicFinder is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to keep track of your Magic Find buffs when you're bag farming in the Mad King's Labyrinth.

Icons for Magic Find buffs are displayed in one or two columns that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed out so you can quickly see what needs to be reapplied. 

Buffs are loosely grouped into three sections according to expiration and availability. Some buffs use alternate icons to more easily distinguish them. For example, the _Ace Racer,_ _Approval of the Mad King_, and _Grudging Approval_ buffs all have the same icon on your in-game Effects Monitor, so MagicFinder uses a racing beetle and cat icon for the first and last, respectively.

All trackable magic find buffs that apply in the Labyrinth should be included. See the wiki for a [complete list Magic Find buffs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find#Attribute).

Only a few food and utility effects are currently implemented, so users may need to manually add the two effect IDs for whichever nourishment they're using ([see this wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Nourishment_effect_ids) for nourishment effect IDs).

Included Food: Chocolate Omnomberry Cream, Peppermint Omnomberry Bar

Included Utility: Flask of Pumpkin Oil, Lump of Crystallized Nougat, Sharpening Skull
